Solving a diabolical sudoku puzzle:

1. FIND the nearest cell with 2 possible numbers (assuming one exists). 
Alternately, find the nearest cell with the fewest possible numbers.

2. Take the current sudoku grid and PUSH it to an array of nodes (for later reference if needed).
Make 2 COPIES (ie two branches). Apply one possible number to one copy and apply the other 
possible number to the other copy. PUSH the copies to an array of forks.

3. Try to solve the first copy. IF solved then exit the solving loop.

4. A dead end is reached when any cell has no value assigned and no possible numbers remaining.
IF a branch has a dead end then move to the next branch without a dead end in the array of forks.
ELSE IF a branch does not give a solution but does not have a dead end either, then go back to step 1 with this branch 
and create two more branches.
IF all branches have dead ends then return to step 1 and FIND the next cell with 2 possible numbers.
(Marking the last picked cell as being a fork node may help with this).
