# Sudoku-Solver

[**Codepen Demo**](https://codepen.io/steve-dave108/full/NWzzbpX)

A small program using JavaScript to solve Sudoku puzzles. It can handle Diagonal Sudoku and Diabolical Sudoku puzzles.

I learned a lot about Sudoku while making this. The flowchart I put together gives an overview of the program and may help if you'd like to try manually solving a puzzle first.
